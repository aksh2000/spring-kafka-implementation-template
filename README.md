# Spring Kafka Implementation Template

This repository provides a Spring Boot template for implementing Kafka producers and consumers. The template includes abstract service classes that simplify the integration of Kafka into Spring Boot applications. It offers a starting point for producing and consuming messages with Kafka, complete with configurable settings and error handling.

## Features

- **Kafka Producer Template**: Abstract class for producing messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Kafka Listener Template**: Abstract class for listening to and processing messages from a Kafka topic.
- **Asynchronous Message Production**: Non-blocking message sending.
- **Error Handling**: Basic logging and handling for failures in message production and consumption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11+**: Ensure you have Java 11 or higher installed.
- **Apache Kafka**: You need a running Kafka broker. For local development, [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads) can be installed and run using default settings.
- **Maven or Gradle**: Build tool to manage dependencies and build the project.

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-kafka-implementation-template.git
   
2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd spring-kafka-implementation-template
   
3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    mvn install
   
4. **Configure Kafka:**
   
    Update src/main/resources/application.properties or application.yml with your Kafka server details.
    ```bash
   spring:
      kafka:
         bootstrap-servers= localhost:9092

## Usage
### Kafka Producer
- Extend the KafkaProducerService class to create your producer. 
- Implement any additional logic required for your use case.
   - Check ```service -> config -> KafkaProducerStore.Java``` for reference
- Inject and use the producer in your service or controller to send messages to Kafka.

### Kafka Consumer
- Extend the KafkaListener class to create your listener. 
- Implement the processing logic and validation for received messages (Optional).
- Spring Boot will automatically detect and register your listener component to handle messages from Kafka.

Feel free to modify this template according to your project's needs and conventions. This README should help others understand how to use your Kafka producer and listener services in Spring Boot applications.
